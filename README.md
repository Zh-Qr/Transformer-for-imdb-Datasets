# Transformer-for-imdb-Datasets
The construction for standard Transformer and specific construction for IMDA Datasets
---
This repository include the detail of constructing a standard Transformer model and the procedure of training based on an Artificial data   
**basic_torch_transformer.ipynb:** show the detail of standard Transformer model
---
Also, we use the specific Transformer model to train on the IMDB Datasets.
**transformer_imdb_torch.ipynb:** show the detail of constructing model, training and predicating
**transformer_text_classification.py:** The whole py file of training the text classification based on Transformer
**transformer_text_test.py:** The whole py file of testing the pre-trained model
